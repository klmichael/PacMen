# Project Title: PacMen Factory

## Description of Project: 
This project started with an assignment from Professor John Williams in my MIT XPro Bootcamp in week 7.  We were given starter files that included a PacMan factory to generate an array of PacMen and associated image elements on the html page.

After ensuring that the PacMan would change direction upon hitting the bounds of the screen, I then added to coding to create the mouth chomping and flipping effects.

I then added a third button, which will delete a random PacMan from both the array and the HTML page.

*Additional Coding:* Kathryn Michael

## How to Run:

Download these six files and save them itogether in a directory:
- index.html
- pacmen.js
- PacMan1.png
- PacMan2.png
- PacMan3.png
- PacMan4.png

Open index.html in your browser. You should now be able to play the game in your browser.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements:

In the future, I would like the user to be able to click on a specific PacMan to delete it from the game.  I would also like to update the styling so that the PacMen do not cover any of the buttons at any time.
